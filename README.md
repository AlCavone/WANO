As Robbie Rotten on LazyTown,  has given laughter to children around the world. He created a foundation to help stop bullying.  He is a tireless advocate for special needs children.

And now Stefan Karl needs our help.

Stefan has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The operation he has had will prevent him from working for up to a year.

We want him to use that year to rest and recuperate so that he can once again return to what he does best - making kids smile all over planet Earth.

We are raising funds to help Stefan and his family survive the coming year.  Not only will they need assistance with medical bills, but it's important that Stefan be allowed to heal his body and spirit without the additional burden of financial need.

We appreciate any amount of gift you are able to extend to Stefan and his family. As he moves from this difficult time toward a full recovery, we ask for your generosity, your prayers and good wishes.

As Robbie Rotten would ask, "Why are those people making all that noise!?"

Let's answer Robbie with a thunderous noise of gratitude and joy for everything he's given to the world of children's entertainment!

Help spread the word!
